Describe how you would thoroughly test the "www.freshly.com/login" page below:

I would test the page based off of the questions below. They are based off a blend of different test types.

UI Tests
- Can the page load?
- Do I get the company logo?
- Do I get proper input validation?
- Can I use keyboard shortcuts to quickly login, such as tabs and clicking enter when I'm done?
- Is the page responsive so that it supports all screen sizes 
- Do all the routing and navigation buttons take me to where they are supposed to?
- Am I logged in and taken to the home page after posting successful credentials?

API Tests
- Can I perform POST login requests?
- Do I received a token after successful login?
- If I clear the token after successful login, can I perform other API requests successfully?
- Are there any input field restrictions like max character size?
- Are there password validation requirements on the API request?

UX and Usability Tests
- If I fail to login, do I get a message instructing me to check credentials?
- If I use the Forgot Password, will I be routed properly, and will I be able to login successfully afterward?
- Can I create a new account successfully?
- If I have a URL, but I am redirected to the login page first, will I be redirected back to the original URL after successful login?
- Are there max login attempts?

Compatibility Tests
- Can I login any all supported browsers?
- Can I login on a computer as well as on a mobile device?

Performance Tests
- How many users can login at once before a performance hit?
